CHANGELOG


August/2006 -- Mark Grimshaw
v3.1
Major feature enhancements and minor bug fixes.

NB
1/ Because of additions to the bibliographic/citation templating system, administrators who have created their 
own style should, after installing v3.1, open, edit (with changes if necessary) and save their styles in 
the OSBIB style editor before using them.
2/ index.php that used to be in OSBib/create/ has now been moved to the top level of OSBib/.  Additionally, index.php includes() osbibConfig.php which sets the paths and classes used in create/.  Users using the bibliographic and/or citation formatting engines outside of create/ will need to edit or duplicate elsewhere the define() statements in osbibConfig.php.

FEATURES:
1/ When editing a bibliographic/citation style, in addition to previewing bibliographic templates, footnote 
templates and in-text citation formatting can now be previewed.
2/ The preview option when editing bibliographic styles now allows template fields to be turned on and off within 
the preview popup.  Additionally, any non-generic template that is empty will drop back to the generic fallback 
style for preview purposes.
3/ Added a new syntax rule for bibliographic/citation templates that governs whether fields are displayed 
dependent upon the existence of either the preceeding or the subsequent field.  See 
index.php?action=help for details.
4/ Books and book chapters can now have details for the original work the resource was translated from 
(translated title, publisher details and year).
5/ Added a parameter to the XML bibliographic/citation styles for setting the range (entire text or paragraph) 
to control the use of the subsequent creator template for in-text citations.
6/ Improved the parsing for sentences when parsing citations.
7/ Added a partial template to each resource's bibliographic template to allow for a partial re-ordering of 
initial fields if the first field is not present in the resource.  For example, in APA style if there is no 
creator, print the title before the publication year in bibliographic lists. Administrators see NB 2/ above.
8/ Added another resource type 'Miscellaneous Section' which is intended for miscellaneous resources that are a 
part of a larger collection.
9/ For in-text citations added new style field: only use the subsequent citation template if the sentence containing the citation has the creator surname, title or shortTitle in it. Administrators see NB 2/ above.
10/ For in-text citations added new style field: if the template being used contains the title or shortTitle and either of those fields exists in the same sentence, remove those fields from the template so that they do not appear in the citation.
11/ Title/subtitle formatting has been reworked to apply the same capitalization rules to the subtitle as to the title and to ensure that the titleSubtitleSeparator is not added if the title ends in '?', '!', '¡', '¿' or '.'.
12/ In in-text citations (APA style for example), it's now possible to list the URL as the in-text citation where required (e.g. internet sites).


BUG FIXES:
1/ Improvements to the parsing of possessive name form recognition when splitting citations (year then page 
no.) if the citation author's name is in the same sentence as the citation.
2/ In bibliography formatting, names following the first in the primary creator list are now formatted correctly.
3/ Citations where a style (APA for example) states that the citation is split into year and page parts now find 
possessive creator names correctly in both RTF and html output.
4/ Formatting of first names for creators now handles hyphenated first names (thanks to Jean-Francois LaLande).
5/ Braces marking title capitalization are kept when $bibformat->cleanEntry = TRUE;
6/ Improved matching criteria for when the subsequent template is used for in-text citations.


21/Nov/2005 -- Mark Grimshaw
v3.0
Major feature enhancements and minor bug fixes.

FEATURES:
1/ Added citation formatting.  Developers can now send a body of text with citation markup to the citation formatting engine for either in-text and endnote-style (endnotes or footnotes) citation formatting and appending of bibliographies.  The citation engine requires the installation of the bibliographic engine.
2/ Bibliographic formatting: further options for edition and day fields.
3/ It is now possible to further define creator strings in resource style templates to cope with more complex styles such as DIN1505.
4/ Bibliographic/citation formatting now adds footnote templates to the bibliographic templates for each resource type.  This is for styles such as Chicago which use a different format for footnotes and for the complete bibliography.

BUG FIXES:
1/ Tidied up detection of multiple punctuation in bibliographies.
Various other minor fixes.

17/July/2005 -- Mark Grimshaw
v2.1
1/  Added further date formatting in the general bibliographic options.
2/  Multiple spaces in bibliographic style templates are now correctly rendered in html.

30/June/2005 - Mark Grimshaw & Christian Boulanger
v2.0
1/ A web interface OSBib-Create for creation and editing of XML style files has been added to the package.
2/ The bibtexParse package is now included.
3/ Users should note that this OSBib package replaces OSBib-Format and OSBib-Create which are deprecated and no longer supported.
4/ A preview link is displayed next to each resource type template when editing a style.  (Requires JavaScript and, currently, does not work with Internet Explorer due to query string limits.)

17/June/2005 - Mark Grimshaw
v1.7
1/  Date ranges are now supported in bibliographic styles.
2/  User-defined strings for each of the 12 months may now be supplied in the bibliographic styles.
NB - an upgrade of the bibtexparse package is also required since handling of month fields has been improved in bibtexparse::PARSEMONTHS

08/June/2005
v1.6
Some debugging of creator list formatting in bibliographic styles.  Multiple punctuation following a 
name is now allowed if the punctuation characters are different.

19/May/2005
v1.5
1/ Removed a typo.
2/ Reorganised export filters in preparation for work on citation formatting.
3/ Added OpenOffice 'sxw' format for export.
4/ Added bibliography_xml.html describing the structure of the bibliography section of the XML files.

15/May/2005
v1.4
1/ Better support for UTF-8 multibyte strings provided by Andrea Rossato.
2/ Correction of bibtex solution @inproceedings bug.

6/May/2005
v1.3
1/ Removed some WIKINDX-specific code for bibtex parsing.
2/ Fixed a bug with bibtex 'misc' reference types.
(The above two affect those using STYLEMAPBIBTEX.)
3/ Some error checking code for file paths added by Guillaume Gardey.

5/May/2005
v1.2
1/ Corrected an error in the incorrect formatting of author names for the bibtex solution.
2/ Based on modifications suggested by Christian Boulanger, changed path information to make setting of flags easier or redundant and made the storing and loading of XML files more flexible:
	a) Changed BIBFORMAT constructor call to:
	$bibformat = new BIBFORMAT(STRING: $pathToOsbibClasses = FALSE [, BOOLEAN: $useBibtex = FALSE]);
	By default, $pathToOsbibClasses will be the same directory as BIBFORMAT.php is in.
	b) $bibformat->bibtexParsePath by default is now a bibtexParse/ directory in the same directory as BIBFORMAT.php is
	in. This path is where PARSECREATORS, PARSEMONTH and PARSEPAGE classes can be found if you wish to use
	STYLEMAPBIBTEX.
	c) The XML files are downloaded from bibliophile in uppercase format (e.g. APA.xml).  If you wish to store them in
	lowercase (e.g. apa.xml), BIBF0RMAT::loadStyle() now automatically detects this.
Unless you store PARSECREATORS, PARSEMONTH and PARSEPAGE classes elsewhere, there is now no need to set 
$bibformat->bibtexParsePath.
3/  Added an osbib.html page as a more easily navigable verion of README.

29/April/2005
v1.1
1/  Added an (almost) 'out-of-the-box' BibTeX solution.
2/  Added the method BIBFORMAT::addAllOtherItems().

28/April/2005
v1.0
Initial release
