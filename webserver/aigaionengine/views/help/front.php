  <p class='header1'>Aigaion - A Web based document management system</p>
  <p>The Aigaion system is used to maintain an annotated bibliography. This can be your own personal bibliography, or a database that is shared between a group of people working on similar topics.</p>
  <p>The main features of Aigaion are the <?php echo anchor('help/viewhelp/topictree','topic tree'); ?> and the <?php echo anchor('help/viewhelp/notes','notes'); ?>. The topic tree is used to organize your bibliography in themes and topics, where a publication can be added to any number of topics that are relevant to it. The notes form a way in which you can summarize a paper in your own style, indicate why the paper is relevant for your research, why you think a paper belongs to a certain topic, whether you think the paper succeeded in its intended goal, etc.</p>
